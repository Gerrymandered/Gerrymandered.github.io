        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a student web developer that is passionate about developing a variety of websites. I also have a passion for developing other misc. software. However I am stuck waiting on a different laptop to start developing iOS apps for my phone.</p>
        
        <h2>My Future</h2>
        <p>Using my skills and experiences I plan on expanding my knowledge of programming with iOS apps. Once I have enough funds to buy an Apple MacBook Pro, development starts. I will start to expand my knowledge of computers and programming. I will be making an app to start to learn Objectibe-C and Swift.</p>
        <p>Also, I plan to learn a derivative of C, such as C#, or C++ to also develop Windows and Linux desktop apps. Futhermore, I plan on starting Node.js very soon. I have some very high hopes for my future.</p>
