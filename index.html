        <p>Greetings. I am a basic web developer that is learning how to code.</p>
        <p>This nice looking CSS affect is here to self-demonstrate how much power CSS hactually has.</p>
        <p>One may ask how I got a 'frosted glass' effect like this. To this, I'd respond: "Simple I'll show you." And that I will.</p><br><br>
        <p>Section 1 is the base of the page. It holds the non-blurred background. <br><br>Section 2 is in it's own <code>div</code>. This div displays a seperate background that has been blurred manually.<br>This section can also be repeated as many times
            as needed to suit the site.</p>
        <p>Want the images I used?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>macOS.jpg: <a href="/macOS.jpg" download>Download</a></li>
            <li>macOSblur.jpg: <a href="/macOSblur.jpg" download>Download</a></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>If you see a delta sign instead of an 'A' in the heading and know a fix, please let me know and I'll do my best to fix it. Email: <a href="mailto:matthew@infiniit.co">matthew@infiniit.co</a></p>
